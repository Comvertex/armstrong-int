                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Armstrong International was founded in 1989, initially serving as a key talent provider for Goldman Sachs during its European expansion. In its first decade, Armstrong International successfully placed over 150 individuals at Goldman Sachs, many of whom ascended to partner roles within the organisation. This early success laid a strong foundation for Armstrong International, enabling it to expand its client base to include prestigious institutions such as S.G. Warburg and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Over the years, Armstrong International has broadened its reach across the financial services spectrum, consistently delivering exceptional talent to these universal banks.</p>
